mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + esi*4 + 0x10.  The issue is that if the sum of ebx and esi*4 + 0x10 results in an address outside the allowed memory range (e.g., attempting to access kernel memory or unmapped pages), this will cause a segmentation fault or general protection fault.  This is particularly problematic if esi is a user-controlled value.
